# Supabase Studio — Multi-Head Fork

A self-hosted Supabase dashboard that manages **multiple isolated Supabase projects** from a single Studio instance. Each project gets its own Docker Compose stack with dedicated Postgres, GoTrue, Storage, and Kong containers.

Built on top of [Supabase Studio](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/apps/studio) with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Multi-Head features

| **Embedded projects** | New Postgres database inside an existing instance — no extra containers |
| **PocketBase projects** | Single-container PocketBase stacks (SQLite, REST API, auth, realtime, storage) |
| **PocketBase embedded** | PocketBase via plain `docker run` or as a collection namespace inside an existing PB |
| **PocketBase migration** | Bi-directional data migration between PocketBase and Supabase |
| **Organizations** | Group projects into organizations with role-based access |
| **OAuth setup** | View GoTrue callback URLs for every project in one place |
| **Storage** | See storage API endpoints across all projects |
| **Migrations** | Compare migration state across all projects simultaneously |
| **Backups** | Schedule pg_dump backups and restore with one click or one CLI command |
| **Import from Cloud** | Migrate a Supabase Cloud database to a self-hosted project |
| **Read replicas** | Add streaming replicas to any project [Business] |
| **Warm standby** | Automatic failover with a hot standby [Business] |
| **Cluster mode** | Multi-node read scaling [Enterprise] |
| **Authelia 2FA/SSO** | Optional two-factor authentication in front of the nginx proxy |

## Database Backups

Schedule automatic `pg_dump` backups for any project and restore in one click.

### In the Studio UI

Go to **Project Settings → Backups**. From there you can:

- Set a **daily** or **weekly** automatic backup schedule
- Trigger a backup immediately with **Run backup now**
- **Download**, **restore**, or **delete** any existing backup

Backups are stored as compressed `.pgdump` files under `${STUDIO_DATA_DIR}/backups/{project-ref}/`.

### Via the CLI

```bash
# List backups and schedule
smh backup list <ref>

# Trigger a backup now
smh backup run <ref>

# Set automatic schedule
smh backup schedule <ref> daily
smh backup schedule <ref> weekly
smh backup schedule <ref> off

# Restore (requires --confirm — overwrites the live database)
smh backup restore <ref> <filename> --confirm

# Download a backup file to disk
smh backup download <ref> <filename>
smh backup download <ref> <filename> --out /path/to/save.pgdump

# Delete a backup
smh backup delete <ref> <filename>
```

> **Note:** Backups require the project to be running (the pg_dump runs inside the project's Postgres container via `docker exec`).

---

## Migrate from Supabase Cloud

Move an existing Supabase Cloud database to a self-hosted project in a few steps.

### In the Studio UI

1. Go to **Projects → Import from Cloud**
2. Enter your cloud project's **direct** database connection string
   - Find it under: *Project Settings → Database → Connection string → URI*
   - Use `db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432` — not the pooler URL
3. Select the target self-hosted project
4. Choose which schemas to migrate (default: `public`)
5. Optionally check **Schema only** to skip row data
6. Click **Next**, review the warning, then **Run migration**

The migration runs `pg_dump` inside the target project's Postgres container and streams the output directly into that project's database. Progress is shown in a live log panel.

### Via the CLI

```bash
# Migrate schema + data (public schema only)
smh migrate <ref> --source "postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Schema only
smh migrate <ref> --source "postgresql://..." --schema-only

# Include additional schemas (e.g. auth users)
smh migrate <ref> --source "postgresql://..." --schemas public,auth
```

> **Note:** The target project must be running and healthy before migrating. Existing objects in the selected schemas will be dropped and recreated.

## PocketBase projects

PocketBase is a self-contained backend (SQLite, REST API, auth, realtime, file storage) that runs as a single binary or Docker container.

### Deploy modes

| Mode | Description | Docker |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `pocketbase` | Full Docker Compose stack | New Compose project per PB instance |
| `pocketbase-embedded` | Plain `docker run` | Single container, no Compose project |
| `pocketbase-embedded --target <ref>` | Collection namespace inside an existing PB | No new container |

### In the Studio UI

1. Go to **Projects → New project**
2. Select **PocketBase** or **PocketBase (embedded)** as the deployment mode
3. For embedded, optionally pick a target PocketBase project from the dropdown to share its instance
4. Once running, go to **Project Settings → PocketBase** for credentials and admin URL

### Via the CLI

```bash
# Standalone PocketBase (Docker Compose)
smh create "my-pb" --mode pocketbase

# Lightweight PocketBase (docker run, no Compose)
smh create "my-pb" --mode pocketbase-embedded

# Logical namespace inside an existing PocketBase project
smh create "my-ns" --mode pocketbase-embedded --target <ref>
```

### Migrating data between PocketBase and Supabase

```bash
# PocketBase → Supabase (collections become tables)
smh pb-migrate <ref> \
  --direction pb-to-supa \
  --pb-url http://localhost:8090 \
  --pb-email admin@example.com \
  --pb-password mypassword

# Supabase → PocketBase (tables become collections)
smh pb-migrate <ref> \
  --direction supa-to-pb \
  --pb-url http://localhost:8090 \
  --pb-email admin@example.com \
  --pb-password mypassword

# Or use the Studio UI: Project Settings → PocketBase → Migrate tab
```

---

## Lean / minimal deployment

`docker/docker-compose.minimal.yml` converts every optional service to opt-in via Docker Compose profiles. Run it when you want a lighter stack or don't need every component.

```bash
# Core stack only (db, auth, rest, kong, studio, meta)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d

# Add components back selectively
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.minimal.yml \
  --profile storage --profile realtime up -d
```

| Profile | Enables |
|---------|---------|
| `realtime` | Realtime WebSocket subscriptions |
| `storage` | Storage API + imgproxy image transformations |
| `edge-functions` | Edge Functions (Deno runtime) |
| `pooler` | Supavisor connection pooler (ports 5432 / 6543) |
| `analytics` | Logflare + Vector log pipeline |

Can be combined with other overlays. Use `smh overlay` to print ready-to-run compose commands.

## What's included

Studio is designed to work with existing deployments - either the local hosted, docker setup, or our CLI. It is not intended for managing the deployment and administration of projects - that's out of scope.

As such, the features exposed on Studio for existing deployments are limited to those which manage your database:

- Table & SQL editors
  - Saved queries are unavailable
- Database management
  - Policies, roles, extensions, replication
- API documentation

## Managing Project Settings

Project settings are managed outside of the Dashboard. If you use docker compose, you should manage the settings in your docker-compose file. If you're deploying Supabase to your own cloud, you should store your secrets and env vars in a vault or secrets manager.

## How to contribute?

- Branch from `master` and name your branches with the following structure
  - `{type}/{branch_name}`
    - Type: `chore | fix | feature`
    - The branch name is arbitrary — just make sure it summarizes the work.
- When you send a PR to `master`, it will automatically tag members of the frontend team for review.
- Review the [contributing checklists](contributing/contributing-checklists.md) to help test your feature before sending a PR.
- The Dashboard is under active development. You should run `git pull` frequently to make sure you're up to date.

### Developer Quickstart

> [!NOTE]  
> **Supabase internal use:** To develop on Studio locally with the backend services, see the instructions in the [internal `infrastructure` repo](https://github.com/supabase/platform/blob/develop/docs/contributing.md).

```bash
# You'll need to be on Node v20
# in /studio

## For external contributors
pnpm install # install dependencies
pnpm run dev # start dev server

## For internal contributors
## First clone the private supabase/platform repo and follow instructions for setting up mise
mise studio  # Run from supabase/platform alongside `mise infra`

## For all
pnpm run test # run tests
pnpm run test -- --watch # run tests in watch mode
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sign-in fails with `POST /undefined/token` (404)

Kong logs show requests to `/undefined/token?grant_type=password` or `/undefined/sso`.

**Cause:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOTRUE_URL` is a Next.js public env var that is **baked into the browser bundle at build time**. Setting it as a runtime Docker environment variable (e.g. in `docker-compose.multihead.yml`) has no effect on a pre-built image — the browser-side code already has `undefined` compiled in.

**Fix A — pass it as a build arg (recommended for custom builds):**

```bash
# Default for local / single-host deployments:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GOTRUE_URL=http://localhost:8000/auth/v1

docker build . -f apps/studio/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_GOTRUE_URL=http://<your-kong-host>/auth/v1 \
  --target production \
  -t studio-multihead:latest
```

**Fix B — use the pre-built image with a runtime config endpoint:**

The released image includes a fallback: when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOTRUE_URL` is absent from the bundle, the browser derives the GoTrue URL from its own origin (`window.location.origin + '/auth/v1'`). This works for any standard self-hosted deployment where Kong routes `/auth/v1` to GoTrue.

If you have a non-standard routing setup, rebuild the image with Fix A above.

## Running within a self-hosted environment

Follow the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/docker) to get started.

```
cd ..
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f ./dev/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Once you've got that set up, update `.env` in the studio folder with the corresponding values.

```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
```

Then run the following commands to install dependencies and start the dashboard.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you would like to configure different defaults for "Default Organization" and "Default Project", you will need to update the `.env` in the studio folder with the corresponding values.

```
DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_NAME=
DEFAULT_PROJECT_NAME=
```
